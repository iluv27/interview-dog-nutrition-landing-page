# Dog Nutrition Landing Page

This project is a static landing page built as part of a frontend interview task.

## Project Overview
The goal of this task was to accurately translate a provided Figma design into a functional and responsive web page. The focus was on layout accuracy, spacing, colors, and visual consistency rather than complex functionality.

## Tools Used
- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS (CDN)
- VS Code
- GitHub
- Vercel

No JavaScript frameworks were used because the page is fully static.

## Design Implementation
- All images, SVG icons, and the GIF used on the page were exported directly from the provided Figma file.
- Colors were taken from the Figma design to ensure visual consistency.
- Spacing, layout structure, and sizing were implemented to closely match the measurements shown in the Figma file.
- Icons were exported as SVG files to maintain quality and accuracy.
- The layout was built with responsiveness in mind, with adjustments for smaller screen sizes.
